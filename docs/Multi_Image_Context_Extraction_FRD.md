# Functional Requirements Document

## Title: Multi-Image Context Extraction System

**Purpose:**  
This document outlines the functional requirements for a system that uses a LangGraph-based agent to extract unified context from multiple images and present it as a single, cohesive story.

---

## Functional Overview

The Multi-Image Context Extraction System will:

- Allow the user to input a set of images.
- Generate a single, coherent narrative that ties all the images together.
- Utilise a LangGraph agent to process and relate the images.
- Be implemented in TypeScript.
- Be deployable as a Docker container.
- Be testable within LangGraph Studio.

---

## Requirements

1. **Input Format:**

   - The system must accept multiple images in a single request.
   - Images can be provided as base64-encoded strings or URLs.

2. **Contextual Narrative Generation:**

   - The agent must generate a unified story that spans all provided images.
   - The narrative must logically connect the visual content and provide meaningful context for the sequence.

3. **Technology Stack:**

   - The core logic must be written in TypeScript.
   - LangGraph must be used for constructing the agent logic and integrating it with LangGraph Studio.

4. **Agent Integration:**

   - The agent must be compatible with LangGraph’s format and tools.
   - The agent’s logic must be testable within LangGraph Studio to ensure correct behavior and proper handling of multiple images.

5. **Deployment Requirements:**

   - The entire system must run as a Docker container.
   - The container must expose appropriate endpoints for accepting input and returning the generated narrative.
   - The Docker image must be easy to build and deploy.

6. **Configuration Options:**

   - The number of images to process can be configured via environment variables.
   - Logging and debug modes must be configurable within the Docker container for troubleshooting purposes.

7. **Performance and Scalability:**

   - The system must handle at least 10 images per request without significant performance degradation.
   - It must respond within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 5 seconds for 10 images) when running on a modern container host.

8. **Error Handling:**

   - The system must provide clear error messages for invalid image formats or unsupported input types.
   - If a single image fails to process, the system should still attempt to generate a story from the remaining images.

9. **Testing and Validation:**
   - The agent’s logic must be tested using LangGraph Studio’s testing capabilities.
   - Unit tests must be written in TypeScript to ensure all logical paths are covered.
   - End-to-end tests should validate that the containerized application behaves as expected in a real-world scenario.

---

## Expected Output

- A single narrative that ties together the provided images into a coherent story.
- The story should be delivered as a JSON response from the agent’s API when running in the Docker container.
- The narrative must reflect the content and sequence of all input images.

---

## Assumptions and Constraints

- The images are assumed to be relevant to one another and part of the same visual context.
- The system relies on LangGraph for agent logic and LangGraph Studio for testing.
- The Docker container must run on a Linux-based container host with a modern kernel.
